# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 🎮 About the Game
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where a player competes against an AI opponent. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to get three of your marks (X) in a row before the computer (O) does.

## 📜 How to Play
1. Run the game using Python.
2. The board is numbered from 1 to 9 as shown below:
   ```
    1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
    4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
    7 | 8 | 9
   ```
3. The player is 'X' and the computer is 'O'.
4. The player takes the first turn by choosing a position (1-9).
5. The computer will then make its move automatically.
6. The game continues until:
   - A player wins by forming a row, column, or diagonal of three marks.
   - The board is full, resulting in a draw.
7. At the end of the game, the player can choose to play again or exit.
